	// Easy type has its own table, model, service, and router. 
	// In the UserSecret table, we must create a foreign key to associate with it. 
	// This approach has some benefits: Each type can be modulized, decoupled and scales as needed. 
	// It also applies different levels of security to the table schema. 
	// Letâ€™s discuss this more in the follow-up interview and discuss how to implement it.
